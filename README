Captain is an all-in-one remote machine controller. This allows simple, efficient and scalable control of remote machines with dynamic IP addresses.

1. Start an instance with -mode serve
    captain -mode serve -key mykey

2. Start instance(s) with -mode obey
    captain -mode obey -key mykey -target http://my.server:1992

3. Send commands to the server (the default is -mode send)
    captain -key mykey -target http://my.server:1992 echo hello_world

By default, the obeying instances poll for the command every 10 seconds.
